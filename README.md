###Types of Slavery

* Sex Trafficking - A person is considered a victim of sex trafficking when they are forced into prostitution and then kept in a prison of the mind, while being deprived of payment.
* Labor Trafficking - A person is forced to work without pay.
* Organ Trafficking - A person is forced to remain in an inclusor, like a prison and there non-vital organs are removed, without their consent.

###How People Become Slaves

* Sex Trafficking Manipulation - Using manipulation, a trafficker can slowly over the period of months or even a year, remove the victims entire group of friends and family, making the trafficker their soul source of support.  Then the trafficker uses violence and often rape to keep the victim afraid - 

* Labor Trafficking Kidnapping - Workers are promised fair wages and work in another country.  They are head hunted by a subcontracting company and brought to a new country.  Upon arrival their passports are taken and under the threat of violence of death they are brought to a confined location to perform menial labor.

* Sex Trafficking Kiddnapping - An individual is kidnapped and used for commercial sex, against their will.

* Labor Trafficking Debt Bondage - An individual or family member incurs a debt.  In order to repay the debt, the individual is forced to work for very meanial wages, which will never amount to enough to leave the debt bondage.  Artificial charges are levied against the individual, so that their sentence becomes longer and longer.

* Organ Trafficking Political imprisonment - Typically this occurs when a group of dissidents are incarcerated by a specific government.  It is difficult to run a successful organ trafficking trade without access to substantial resources, like prisons.  Therefore this type of trafficking disproportially affects political prisoners. 

###How I am trying to help

In order to aid in preventing trafficking, I am working on a system for law enforcement called investigator.  The goal of the system is to be able to identify high level trends from open data.  The long term goal of the system is to integrate open and closed data to create a complete view of trafficking in America.
